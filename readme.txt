//// Story

You are an intern in a wall painter company.
The work of colours is an everyday practice.
But apart from the old days, colors are digitalized
and printed according to the code, you enter.
A customer wants a specific colour for his/her item.
You are given a sample of the colour, and your challenge
is to find the matching colour code (RGB/HEX).
Since you are an intern on your first day, your first
three challenges are helped by the answer, for you to
gain knowledge of how the RGB/HEX code works.
Hereafter your boss assume that you are clever enough
to go on by your self.

Good Luck, and Happy Colour-coding!
